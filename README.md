1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. There are variables defined in `index.js` that you will use in the exercises.
3. Attempt to do each exercise on your own.
4. Use documentation as a resource if needed, but try to avoid stack overflow, blogs, etc.
5. Use index.html to run your code in dev tools. Use console.logs and debugger to debug your code.
